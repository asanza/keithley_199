Data is shifted in Positive clock Transitions. (It means data is valid on trailing edge (negative transition)
Data is received INVERTED in analog board (the optocoupler inverts).
Strobe shifts data to out. Strobe is also inverted in analog board.

5 bytes are sended each time (there are 5 shift registers, four on analog board and one on scanner card.). The last byte controls the analog digital converter.

Last Register Bits: (Digital Board)

Cal: When 0 is the reference connected to the A/D
Zero: When 0  the multiplexer selects ground for input to the A/D
Fast:
ReadSwitch: When 0 in Analog board, the position of front/rear switch is readed (-4.3 and volts/ohms lo)
Sig: When 1 in analog board, 3V signal direct to A/D
/FinalSlope:	Starts the Rundown slope integration
Sync: Resets AD Clocks
Int: (Start Conversion)



The conversion sequence is as follows. 

- Integration Vin
- Integration Vin Zero
- Integration Vref
- Integration Vref Zero

Vout = -2.8*(Vin - VinZero)/(Vref - VrefZero)

30 V requeriments requerew a separate zero
